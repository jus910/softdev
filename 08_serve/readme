# Team Ducks: Ryan Lee, Justin Mohabir, Selena Ho
## Plan 
- Look through all of the versions of app.py and store the notes on their respective files 
- Using the code from v4 and k06_py-csv as a template to complete the assignment 
- Change the output from v4 to be a random occupation 
- Once we have random occupations printing in the website, add in the TNPG and roster and the list of occupations
- Add a hyperlink to output
## Disco 
v0
- Changing the name of "hello_world" function doesn't change anything
- The route function can't return an integer
- Clicking on link runs helloworld
v1
- when we run this it does nor print _main_ in the terminal
v2
- Prints statement in the terminal
v3 
- /usr/bin/python3: No module named thonny.plugins.cpython.app error
- when debug mode is on
- MUST DEDICATE A TERMINAL FOR FLASK
- we can change the hello_world() and reloading the page changes
- app.debug() = true updates 

- the string that is returned by the function that is assigned to the route is in html
- The dictionary looks pretty with JSON when we return a dictionary in the route function
## QCC 
- What is JSON?
