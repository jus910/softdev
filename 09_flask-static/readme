K09 -- flask with static webpages
2022-10-1
time spent: 0.9
DISCO:
- When we did http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html instead of http://localhost:5000/static/foo Chrome opened a webpage with the contents of foo.html 
- Doing http://localhost:5000/static/foo downloaded a plain text file foo
- Have to run app.py before you're able to access foo.html
- Reloading the website after you change foo.html loads the updates
- We can link foo.html to app.py --> changing foo.html changes what is displayed on the web browser
QCC:
- What is the point of foo?
- How is a web server related to what we're doing and what is its role?
