Disco: 
- We have to have everything within the execute string verbatim as how the command is in the sql shell
- Spelling counts
- open function creates a file object 
- dictReader creates a iterable object where each row is a dictionary with headings as keys
- execute takes a string as an input and runs it in the sqlite shell
- 
QCC:
- Is there a cleaner way to use the execute function in python?
