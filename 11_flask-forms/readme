Disco:
- Print app prints <Flask 'app'>
- print request prints the address that the terminal is requesting to use
- print rqeust.args() prints ImmutableMultiDict([])
  - Immutable dictionary stores the username values which is why they should not be changed 
  or include repeat values
- Headers are information about the browser, operating system, and terminal being used
 - action="/auth" in the html file connects the username information to the route "/auth
  " in backend
- When we add a username to the query then a data type of 'username' and the username are saved
  along with a (sub1, and 'submit Query') from the login.html file
- A multidictinary is a sub-class of dic that can contain multiple values for the same key
QCC:
what does methods=['GET', 'POST']) mean?
Predictions: 
- disp_loginpage() will print many statements in the terminal 
- print(app) will print an address 
- print(request.args) and print(request.headers) will print 

-authenticate() will 
html form inputs
