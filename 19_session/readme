DISCO :
- import many a things
- forms will store information in the request.forms when a post request is called
- cookies are linked to the random key (same random key means same cookies)
- session.pop() will remove all data from the session
- url_for('fxn') will get url of a fxn
- redirect(url) will bring user to the url
 QCC:
- Should we store a secret_key for each user?
