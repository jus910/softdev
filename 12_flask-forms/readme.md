DISCO

We can activate a post command by forcing it, in the html file with method="POST"

POST VS GET
 - GET has the username information in the url
 - POST does not have the username, just /auth
 - GET saves the username in request.args
 - POST saves the username in request.forms

QCC
- How exactly does jinja work?
